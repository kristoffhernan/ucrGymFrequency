# UCR SRC Frequency
This python program uses requests_html and csv libraries to scrape info from [Connect2Concepts](https://connect2concepts.com/connect2/?type=circle&key=593DB611-499B-418E-8082-7263A32860D5). 

The information on the website shows the count of people in different areas of the SRC and is updated every 1-3 hours. I scrape the website every 30 minutes. 

Once the school year begins I want to scrape for at least 2 months, but ideally the entire Fall quarter.
